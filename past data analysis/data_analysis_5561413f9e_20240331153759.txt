Based on the provided YouTube transcript, we want to create a trading strategy that incorporates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with modified settings, multi-timeframe analysis, and price action confirmation. Here's a summary of the strategy rules:

1. Adjust the RSI settings to an overbought level of 80 and an oversold level of 20 to create stronger signals.
2. Use multiple timeframes for confirmation:
   - Verify an RSI signal on a shorter timeframe (e.g., 1-minute).
   - Confirm it with the next higher timeframes (e.g., 5-minute and 15-minute).
3. Look for price action confirmation:
   - Identify hesitation patterns such as a double bar break (two candles showing signs of hesitancy, followed by a break below the low of these bars for a short, or above the high of these bars for a long).
   - Enter the trade when price breaks the pattern's boundary.
4. Set a stop loss above the high (for shorts) or below the low (for longs) of the pattern.
5. Take partial profits when the RSI returns to the midline.
6. Take remaining profits when the price reaches the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price).

Additionally, the RSI can be used to find the strength of trends:
- Determine if the market is trending.
- For uptrends, the RSI should be between 50 and 80.
- For downtrends, the RSI should be between 50 and 20.
- Enter a long position when the RSI in an uptrend pulls back to the midline.
- Enter a short position when the RSI in a downtrend pulls back to the midline.
- Wait for price to bounce off the midline before entering the trade.

To illustrate this strategy, we can implement it in Python using historical price data. We would need to:
1. Calculate the RSI with the new settings (80 and 20).
2. Implement multi-timeframe analysis for confirmation.
3. Design a price action pattern detection (double bar break) function.
4. Set up entry, stop loss, and take profit conditions.

Shall we proceed with implementing this strategy in a Python code example using historical data?
