Here's the corrected plot displaying the synthetic price data, along with the 20-period and 200-period moving averages. The green triangles (^) represent Bullish Elephant Bars, while the red triangles (v) represent Bearish Elephant Bars. These Elephant Bars are characterized as igniting bars that originate around the 20-period moving average and close in the direction of the trend (above the open for bullish bars, below for bearish bars).

Next steps would typically include:

- Defining entry and exit rules based on the strategy.
- Backtesting the strategy with historical data to determine its effectiveness.
- Refining criteria for congestive areas and exhaustion.
- Implementing stop-loss levels and maximum loss per trade.

Would you like to proceed with this kind of analysis, or do you have any other specific instructions for this trading strategy?
My apologies, I forgot to include synthetic "Open" data to determine if a bar is bearish or bullish.

I'll go ahead and rectify this by generating synthetic open prices for the dataset. Let's add these open prices and then re-define the conditions for bullish and bearish Elephant Bars.
Certainly, let's proceed with coding the trading strategy based on the rules outlined. We'll define a strategy where we:

1. Identify igniting bars.
2. Look for Elephant Bars originating around the 20-period moving average.
3. Consider igniting bars that clear congestion as a strong signal for continued downward movement.
4. Monitor for bars growing out of congestion, which indicate a high follow-through rate.
5. Distinguish continuation from exhaustion bars based on distance from the 20-period moving average.
6. Implement stops and define maximum loss per trade.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's make some simplifications:

- We'll define an igniting bar as a bar with a much larger range (high - low) than the average range of the preceding bars.
- We'll define an Elephant Bar as an igniting bar that closes in the direction of the trend (bearish for short, bullish for long), and it must originate around the 20-period moving average.
- For simplicity, we'll use the closing price to check proximity to the moving averages.
- We'll define congestion as a period of lower volatility where the price range is smaller than average.

Now, let me simulate a dataset and code the strategy accordingly. First, we will need to generate some synthetic price data that will include moving averages (since actual market data is not available in our current environment). Then, we will implement the strategy on this data.
Based on the provided YouTube transcript, the trading strategy that is described seems to revolve around certain concepts like "igniting bars," "Elephant Bars," and "clearing events," as well as the importance of moving averages, such as the 20-period and the 200-period moving averages. Here is a summary of the strategy rules extracted from the transcript:

1. Recognition of Trend and Maturity:
   - Recognize a bearish downtrend by identifying a series of "igniting" bars.
   - Consider the maturity of the trend, suggesting it may not be a good time to initiate new short positions if the trend is already mature with multiple legs down.

2. Importance of Timing:
   - The ideal time for shorting would have been during the early "igniting" bars rather than later in the trend.

3. Recognition of Powerful Buy and Sell Signals:
   - Power Elephant Bars that originate around moving averages (specifically around the 20-period moving average) are considered strong signals.
   - Red Elephant Bars that originate around both the 20-period and 200-period moving averages and clear a significant amount of data to the left are seen as very powerful.

4. Follow-Through Rates:
   - An igniting bar that also acts as a clearing event (wiping out congestive areas) is said to have more than a 90% follow-through rate for further downside.
   - A bar growing out of congestion is noted as having a 90 plus percent follow-through rate.

5. Continuation vs. Exhaustion:
   - An igniting bar that is too close to the 20-period moving average is considered a sign of continuation, not exhaustion.
   - Exhaustion would be indicated by a drop originating far from the 20-period moving average after multiple drops.

6. Practice Strategy:
   - Practice identifying igniting, continuation, and exhaustion bars.
   - Take snapshots and organize them into folders for better learning and recall.

With this knowledge, we can outline a strategy. Please let me know if you would like me to code this strategy using Python. We will need to obtain historical price data that includes information about the bars and the moving averages.
