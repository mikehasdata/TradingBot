Based on the transcript from the YouTube video, here's a summary of Larry Williams' LW Volatility Breakout strategy for the 5-minute timeframe:

1. **DunChannel Indicator Setup**
   - Length: 96
   - Style: Change color of the lines to Red (for visibility)

2. **Understand the DunChannel Indicator**
   - **Middle Line**: Acts as a mean reversion point; price is naturally attracted to it.
     - Bullish Momentum: Price above the middle line
     - Bearish Momentum: Price below the middle line
   - **Upper and Lower Bands**: Act as support and resistances or breakout points.

3. **Avoid False Signals in Consolidation**
   - In a consolidating market, bands are close together, leading to more false signals.

4. **Confirmations for Entry**
   - **First Confirmation**: Larry Williams Trade Indicator (LWTI)
     - Period: 25
     - Smoothing Period: 20
     - Confirmation: The indicator needs to be green for a long trade, red for short.
   - **Second Confirmation**: Volume Indicator
     - MA Length: 30
     - Enable Volume Moving Average and change its color to white.
     - Confirmation: Volume bars need to be above the white MA line and colored green for a long trade, red for short.

5. **Trading Strategy**
   - For a **Long Trade**:
     - Price touches the upper Red Line.
     - LWTI indicator is green.
     - Volume bars are above the white MA line and are green.
   - For a **Short Trade**:
     - Price touches the lower Red Line.
     - LWTI indicator is red.
     - Volume bars are above the white MA line and are red.
   - **Entry Point**: When all three criteria are met at the same time.

6. **Stop Loss and Take Profit**
   - **Stop Loss**: Usually set below the middle line for long trades or above for short trades. Alternatively, set at the recent swing low/high if there's a large gap between bands and the middle line.
   - **Take Profit**: Set at a 2:1 risk-reward ratio.

7. **Secret Trick**: Support/Resistance Approach
   - Avoid trading near major support or resistance levels.
   - Only enter trades when they're away from these levels, or if a price is breaking through a resistance level with all other indicators aligning.

Now, let's translate this into an actionable trading strategy that can be coded and backtested. To do so, we'd need to implement the strategy logic in code, identify the inputs and parameters for the indicators mentioned, and define the entry, stop-loss, and take-profit rules. If the necessary data and indicators are available, we might perform some backtesting to evaluate the strategy's effectiveness.
