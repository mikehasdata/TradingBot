Based on the transcript, here is the momentum trading strategy using the Williams %R indicator:

**Buy Rules:**
1. **Define the Uptrend:** An uptrend is characterized by a series of higher highs and higher lows.
2. **Candlestick Confirmation:** Look for bold bullish candlesticks that close near the high end of the candlestick to confirm a strong upward momentum.
3. **Williams %R Indicator:** Wait for the Williams %R to show oversold conditions (below -70) and then rally back above the -50 level before initiating a buy.
4. **Protective Stop Loss:** Place the stop loss below the most recent higher low.
5. **Take Profit:** Look for a break below the most recent higher low or when the Williams %R breaks below the -50 level to exit the trade.

**Sell Rules:**
1. **Define the Downtrend:** A downtrend is characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows.
2. **Candlestick Confirmation:** Look for bold bearish candlesticks that close near the low end of the candlestick to confirm a strong downward momentum.
3. **Williams %R Indicator:** In a downtrend, sell after the Williams %R reaches overbought conditions (above -30) and then drops back below the -50 level.
4. **Protective Stop Loss:** Place the stop loss above the most recent lower high.
5. **Take Profit:** Look for a break above the most recent lower high or when the Williams %R indicator breaks above the -50 level to exit the trade.

**Implementation Steps:**
- Use a charting software that allows the use of the Williams %R indicator.
- Set the Williams %R period as recommended to 14 periods.
- Scan for an asset that is in a clear uptrend or downtrend.
- Apply the buy or sell rules as applicable.
- Manage risk carefully by adhering to stop loss and take profit rules.

Let's implement this strategy in Python. I'll need some historical price data to demonstrate the strategy. Would you like me to use data from a particular asset or just choose a random one for demonstration purposes?
