Alright, from the provided transcript, I've derived the swing trading strategy that includes the following elements:

1. **Timeframes**: Weekly, Daily, 4-Hour, with entries primarily based on the 4-Hour chart.

2. **High Time Frame Analysis**: 
   - Determine the overall trend using Weekly and Daily charts.
   - Identify areas of Supply (for downtrends) or Demand (for uptrends) that caused significant structural shifts and left behind an imbalance or a fair value gap.

3. **Entry Criteria**:
   - Look for a corrective retracement back into the zone that caused the significant move.
   - Set a pending order in the Supply or Demand zone that initiated the big price move.
   - Place a stop loss just above or below the recent high or low (against the direction of entry).
   - Target the opposing liquidity or zone for profit-taking.
   - Consider partial or full exit at significant levels or liquidity pools.

4. **Risk Management**:
   - If the position goes into a 2% profit, roll the stop loss up to lock in that 2% gain.
   - Take profit is ideally set for more than a 1 to 2 risk to reward ratio.

Let's summarize and translate this strategy into actionable steps:

1. Use the Weekly chart to identify the overall trend and look for significant Supply or Demand zones.
2. Confirm the trend and structural shifts on the Daily chart.
3. Go to the 4-Hour chart to pinpoint the precise entry within the Supply or Demand zone during a retracement.
4. Set a pending order with the appropriate stop loss and take profit levels.
5. If in profit, adjust the stop loss to ensure a minimum of 2% gain.
6. Monitor the position for additional exit points based on emergent liquidity pools or opposing zones.

The video transcript mentions specific examples that illustrate the application of the strategy, including trades on AUD/CAD, GBP/AUD, and others.

Would you like me to code a simplified version of this strategy for backtesting or further analysis? Please note that the implementation will be based on general principles, as specific details like the exact definitions of `imbalance` or `fair value gap` might require discretionary judgement.
