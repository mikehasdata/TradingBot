Based on the provided transcript of a YouTube video about the trading strategy of a millionaire trader named Christian Kalamji, we can outline a trading strategy as follows:

1. **Risk Management:** 
    - For accounts under $100,000, risk between 0.5% and 1.5% per trade.
    - For accounts over $100,000, risk between 0.25% and 1% per trade.

2. **Strategy Overview:**
    - The strategy focuses on breakout trades.
    - Look for price consolidations within a range for a period of 2 weeks to 2 months.
    - Trade on a one-day timeframe.
    - Identify trends that have been ongoing for 1 to 3 months with at least 30% growth.
    - In some cases, seek trends that show over 100% growth in less than 3 months.

3. **Entry Conditions:**
    - Wait for a strong trend followed by a pullback and consolidation within a range.
    - Ensure the price does not drop below the 50-period SMA during consolidation, preferably staying above the 10-period or 20-period SMA.

4. **Trade Execution:**
    - Execute a long position when the price breaks out of the consolidation range to the upside.
    - Place a stop loss at the bottom of the breakout candle.

5. **Partial Profit Taking:**
    - After three days from taking the trade, take partial profits (one-third to half of the position).
    - Move the stop loss to break even.

6. **Exit Conditions:**
    - The exit signal is when the price crosses below the SMA that it respected during the initial trend.
    - If it respected the 10-period SMA, exit when the price crosses below this SMA.
    - If it respected the 20-period SMA, exit when the price crosses below this SMA.
    - If it respected the 50-period SMA, exit when the price crosses below this SMA.

7. **Indicators Used:**
    - `10 in 1 Different Moving Averages` created by Himanshu with these settings:
        - 10-period SMA in red.
        - 20-period SMA in light blue.
        - 50-period SMA in yellow.
    - Trading volume indicator created by TradingView.

8. **Auxiliary Information:**
    - The video provides examples with Bitcoin and a stock called Axon.
    - It mentions the importance of strong and voluminous breakouts indicating bullish momentum.

To package this into a trading strategy algorithm, we would need to implement the following steps programmatically:

1. Import the historical price data for a selected asset.
2. Calculate the 10-period, 20-period, and 50-period simple moving averages for the asset.
3. Scan the historical data to identify periods of consolidation and breakout.
4. Implement money management rules based on account size.
5. Implement trade entry, partial profit taking, and exit conditions.
