Based on the YouTube transcript, the trading strategy revolves around recognizing RSI divergence in combination with moving average analysis for scalp trading, particularly in a downtrend. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. Look for a strong downtrend where the price action is creating consistently lower lows and lower highs. During a downtrend, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) typically also forms lower lows matching the price action.

2. Use moving averages as an indication of the trend and a reference point for potential reversals. The strategy uses three moving averages: 21-period, 50-period, and 200-period.

3. Identify a divergence by observing when the RSI starts to form higher lows while the price continues to make lower lows. This suggests a weakening of the downtrend and a possible upcoming reversal.

4. Wait for the RSI divergence to be extremely clear. Specifically, look for multiple instances of higher lows on RSI, signaling growing bullish momentum.

5. Confirm bullish momentum when the RSI breaks above the 50 level.

6. Consider entering a long (buy) position when the RSI shows clear divergence and the price action shows signs of reversal such as a hammer candlestick or a break above a resistance level. In this case, the entry point mentioned was 32,372.

7. Target the 21-period moving average as a potential take-profit level, particularly if it aligns with a psychological price level, in this case, just below 32,500.

8. Keep the trade duration short as this is a scalp trade. The trader in the video opts to take profits quickly rather than waiting for a larger move.

9. Perform detailed analysis on a higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute chart) to understand the broader market situation and then switch to a shorter timeframe (e.g., 1-minute chart) for precise entry points.

Before implementing this strategy, it's important to backtest it and consider risk management tactics, such as setting stop-loss orders to minimize potential losses. It's also advisable to paper trade or use a demo account to get accustomed to the strategy without financial risk.

Now let's start by setting up Python code to identify RSI divergence and then we can move on to managing entries and exits based on the strategy:

1. Calculate the RSI.
2. Identify divergence between price lows and RSI lows.
3. Identify the significant moving averages.
4. Find potential entry points when divergence is confirmed and RSI crosses above 50.
