Based on the given transcript, we can outline a momentum trading strategy as follows:

### Momentum Day Trading Strategy

#### Definition of Momentum Trading:
- A momentum stock is one that is moving quickly.
- Momentum traders do not attempt to predict what a stock will do but trade based on actual movements.

#### Entry and Exit Strategy:
1. **Use of Scanners**: Momentum traders use scanners to identify stocks that are starting to move or breakout from their normal range.

2. **News and Fundamental Analysis**: Check for any breaking news or fundamental changes for the stock that is moving. This could be a catalyst for the movement.

3. **Entry Points**:
    - Buy at market open if the stock is showing strong pre-market movement (e.g., after 4 AM but particularly around 7 AM when certain brokerages come online).
    - Look for breakouts through resistance levels or pullback entries for getting into a position.
    - The first clean entry is often at a technical break or when you observe thinning out of sellers at a resistance level on the Level 2 data.
    - Look for retests of breakout levels for potential entries if you missed the initial move.
    
4. **Exit Points**:
    - Set profit targets based on previous resistance levels or a percentage move.
    - Keep an eye on stock momentum and volume to determine when the move is losing steam and it might be time to exit.

5. **Risk Management**:
   - Using stop-loss orders to manage downside risk.
   - Understanding that trading momentum can be very volatile.
   - Smaller position sizes to manage the risk when trading very volatile stocks.
   - Short trade duration to reduce exposure.

#### Specific Tactics Mentioned:
- **Buying High and Selling Higher**: Accepting the counterintuitive process of buying stocks that have already seen a significant increase.

- **Day Trading vs. Swing Trading**: This strategy is primarily for day trading, capitalizing on intraday price movements.

#### Criteria for Momentum Trading (not listed in detail, but mentioned in the transcript):
- There are five criteria used to evaluate whether a stock has the potential to make substantial moves (20%, 30%, 40%, etc.), not detailed in the transcript, but can be learned in the provided classes by the speaker.

#### Case Study and Example Entries:
- For an example stock MSGM, the presenter provides actual trades and discusses their winners and losers, emphasizing a good profit/loss ratio and accuracy.

- They also mention micro pullback and small account strategies.

### Steps to Implement the Strategy:
1. Develop or obtain access to a real-time stock scanner that can identify stocks making significant intraday moves.
2. Configure the scanner to flag stocks with high percentage premarket moves or ones breaking through resistance levels.
3. Monitor news feeds for potential catalysts that could drive stock movement.
4. Execute trades while closely watching technical indicators, Level 2 data, and maintaining discipline in risk management.
5. Continuously evaluate and improve the strategy based on trade outcomes, learning from both successful and unsuccessful trades.

Let me know if you want to proceed with coding this strategy in Python, keeping in mind the complexity and subtlety involved in real-world trading applications and the importance of risk management.
