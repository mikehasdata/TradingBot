The above pseudocode provides a framework for the True Trend Following (TTF) trading strategy described in the video transcript. If you were to implement this strategy using actual trading software, you would replace the stub methods with concrete implementations that interact with market data and a broker's API to place trades. You'd need real-time market data, an understanding of how to apply technical analysis programmatically, and the ability to execute trades automatically.

Please note this framework assumes we are only going long (buy orders) for simplicity. For going short (sell orders), the logic would be mirrored. Also, risk management aspects such as lot size calculation based on the risk per trade are not included and should be implemented according to one's personal risk tolerance. Additionally, this code does not account for slippage, transaction costs, or other real-world trading factors which could affect the profitability of the strategy.

The actual implementation would require robust error checking, handling of edge cases, and thorough backtesting to gauge the strategy's viability before any attempt to trade live. Trading involves risks, and it's essential to trade responsibly.
Based on the provided YouTube transcript, the trading strategy can be summarized as follows:

1. **Trend Following Approach (TTF Method)**: Focus on identifying strong, healthy trends and following them, ignoring most short-term technical patterns. Look for fundamental catalysts that drive market trends.

2. **Market Environments**: Filter out choppy or sideways markets and seek out markets that are trending clearly in one direction.

3. **Buy on Pullbacks**: In a strong uptrend, look to enter trades on pullbacks to support levels.

4. **Trailing Stops with a Vengeance**: Instead of setting a take-profit level, use trailing stops to let winning trades run and capture potentially huge gains. This strategy embraces accepting small losses and being stopped out frequently but aims for occasional large wins to compensate.

5. **Risk Management**: Use relatively tight stop-losses based on a good risk-to-reward ratio, understanding that the majority of trades may be losers, but the goal is to make the winners count significantly more.

6. **Market Structure for Entries and Exits**: Utilize market structure to inform when to enter trades and where to place stop-losses. Initial stop-loss placement is crucial, and as the trade moves into profit, use levels of broken resistance (now support) to trail your stops.

7. **Reacting to the Market**: Instead of trying to predict market moves, react to what the market presents, e.g., trailing stops are moved under broken resistance-turned-support levels.

8. **Mentality for Success**: Be prepared for the psychological aspect of trend following, which includes accepting more frequent small losses while waiting for the big gains.

9. **No Fixed Take-Profits**: Operate without a set take-profit level, allowing for an "unlimited" reward potential when trades run in favor.

10. **Track Record and Transparency**: The strategy emphasizes the importance of having real, verifiable results over time, rather than only showing winning trades or unrealistic risk-to-reward expectations.

Let's build an algorithm to execute this trading strategy. Since we do not have access to live market data and cannot implement fundamental analysis in the current environment, we'll focus on the technical aspects of the strategy and design a Python pseudocode algorithm that a trader might run on their preferred trading platform. The goal is to outline the logic based on the described method.
