The code snippet you've presented generates mock data representing stock prices and volumes for each day within a specified date range. To continue with a backtest, we'll need to implement a simple buy/sell logic and then calculate the performance of our mock trading strategy based on this data.

A simple strategy implementation might look like this:

1. Buy if the closing price is higher than the opening price.
2. Sell a previously bought position if the closing price is lower than the opening price.

For this exercise, we won't handle complex issues like transaction costs or slippage, and we'll assume the ability to buy and sell at the closing price of the day.

Let's write the backtest script using the dataset `df`. I will define a simple class `Backtest` to encapsulate the backtesting logic.
