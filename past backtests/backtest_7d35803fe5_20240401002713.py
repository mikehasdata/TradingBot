# It seems that the backtest resulted in a significant loss, which indicates a poor strategy or potentially an issue with the logic in the backtest script.
#
# Here's the final outcome:
# - Final Portfolio Value: \$0.82
# - Profit: -\$9999.18 (essentially, the entire initial balance was lost)
# - Return Percentage: -99.99%
#
# The portfolio value ended up being less than \$1, which is not a realistic outcome since we did not consider transaction costs, slippage, or the ability to buy fractional shares. The script assumes a very simplistic strategy of buying one share and selling all shares, which is not a practical trading strategy.
#
# To improve the script and potentially achieve better results, we should refine our buy/sell logic and account for transaction costs, slippage, and consider a more nuanced position sizing strategy.
#
# If you have specific rules or enhancements you'd like to apply to this backtest, please let me know, and I can incorporate those changes.
# It looks like I encountered an error while assigning the `portfolio_value` list to the DataFrame. The length mismatch is due to the fact that we started our calculation from the second row (index 1) and did not include a portfolio value for the first row (index 0).
#
# I need to insert a starting portfolio value at the beginning of the `portfolio_value` list that reflects the initial cash balance, so the length matches the DataFrame. I will fix this now.
# We have successfully generated mock data for our backtest. Now, let's proceed with the simple backtesting logic:
#
# 1. Start with an initial cash balance, with no shares owned.
# 2. Iterate over each row in the DataFrame, applying the buy/sell logic based on the strategy.
# 3. Track the transactions and update the positions and cash balance.
# 4. Calculate the portfolio value over time.
# 5. At the end of the backtesting period, print the final portfolio value and compare it with the initial balance.
#
# I'll implement this logic now.
# Certainly! Let's start by executing your code snippet for generating mock data. Then, I will create a Python script for a simple backtest that will include buy/sell logic based on a mock strategy. For this example, let's assume our strategy is:
#
# - Buy if today's closing price is higher than the previous day's closing price.
# - Sell if today's closing price is lower than the previous day's closing price.
#
# We can expand upon or adjust these rules based on your specific requirements, but for now, I'll use these simple logic rules for the demonstration. Let's generate the mock data first.
