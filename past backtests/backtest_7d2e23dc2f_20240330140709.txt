We will use the `backtesting` Python package to code a backtest for the described Break and Retest strategy. The first step is to load the historical data into a pandas DataFrame, then define the backtesting logic, and finally run the backtest using the `Backtest` class from `backtesting`.

Here is how we can roughly code the backtest. Since I don't have access to your local file system, I'll proceed with the assumption that the historical data CSV file has been properly uploaded to the virtual environment at the specified path.

Let's code the backtest:

```python
import pandas as pd
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover

# Load historical data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/BTC-USD-15m-2023-1-01T00_00 (1).csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

class BreakRetestStrategy(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        # Initialize strategy parameters (e.g., significant levels, ATR for stop-loss calculation)
        pass

    def next(self):
        # Define the trading logic here
        
        # Example: check if a break and retest pattern happened
        # NOTE: Actual implementation will depend on details from the strategy and available data
        
        # For the sake of demonstration, let's assume that:
        # - 'high' is the column that contains the high prices
        # - 'low' is the column that contains the low prices
        
        if self.data.Close[-1] < self.data.Close[-2] and self.data.Low[-1] < self.data.low[-2]:
            # A potential breakdown happened
            # Entry logic for short position
            stop_loss = ...  # Define stop loss based on strategy
            profit_target = ...  # Define profit target based on strategy
            self.sell(sl=stop_loss, tp=profit_target)
        
        elif self.data.Close[-1] > self.data.Close[-2] and self.data.High[-1] > self.data.High[-2]:
            # A potential breakout happened
            # Entry logic for long position
            stop_loss = ...  # Define stop loss based on strategy
            profit_target = ...  # Define profit target based on strategy
            self.buy(sl=stop_loss, tp=profit_target)

# Backtest the strategy
initial_account_size = 1000
bt = Backtest(df, BreakRetestStrategy, cash=initial_account_size, commission=.002)
stats = bt.run()
bt.plot()
```

Please note that this is a very simplistic version of the strategy and does not consider many nuances such as the identification of psychological levels, the complex decision-making process described in the video, and the risk management techniques. Fleshing out those details would require a more advanced implementation, which may involve specific functions to analyze market conditions and trigger trades accordingly.

Moreover, the above code is a template and would need actual logic for determining entry, exit, and stop-loss points based on the specifics provided in the video. The historical data CSV file format should also match expectations in terms of columns and naming conventions.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with implementing more specific parts of the strategy based on the structure I provided.
