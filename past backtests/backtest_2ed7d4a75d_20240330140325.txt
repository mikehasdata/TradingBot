It appears that my current environment does not have the `backtesting` module installed, which I would usually need to run the backtest. However, as we discussed earlier, for the purposes of this activity, we will focus on the pseudo-code and strategy logic rather than running an actual backtest. As such, I will provide you with the code that would hypothetically be used for the backtest if the `backtesting` module were available.

Let's proceed by creating the code snippet with the strategy logic based on the ELITE trading strategy:

```python
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover
import pandas as pd

# Define the ELITE trading strategy
class ELITETrendBreakoutReversalStrategy(Strategy):
    n1 = 50  # Period for the SMA
    n2 = 20  # Period for Bollinger Bands

    def init(self):
        # Initialize the indicators
        close = self.data.Close
        self.sma = self.I(close.rolling(self.n1).mean)
        self.bollinger_h = self.I(lambda s: s + 2 * s.rolling(self.n2).std(), close)
        self.bollinger_l = self.I(lambda s: s - 2 * s.rolling(self.n2).std(), close)

    def next(self):
        # Implement the strategy logic
        # Entry conditions
        if not self.position:
            if self.data.Close[-1] > self.sma[-1] and self.data.Close[-2] <= self.sma[-2]:
                self.buy()
            elif self.data.Close[-1] < self.sma[-1] and self.data.Close[-2] >= self.sma[-2]:
                self.sell()
            
            if self.data.High[-1] > self.bollinger_h[-1] and not self.position.is_long:
                self.buy()
            elif self.data.Low[-1] < self.bollinger_l[-1] and not self.position.is_short:
                self.sell()

        # Exit conditions
        elif self.position.is_long and self.data.Close[-1] < self.sma[-1]:
            self.position.close()
        elif self.position.is_short and self.data.Close[-1] > self.sma[-1]:
            self.position.close()

# Load historical data into a DataFrame
historical_data_path = '/mnt/data/BTC-USD-15m-2023-1-01T00_00 (1).csv'
data = pd.read_csv(historical_data_path, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)

# Set up the backtest
backtest = Backtest(data, ELITETrendBreakoutReversalStrategy, cash=10000, commission=.002)

# Run the backtest
results = backtest.run()

# Print the backtest results
print(results)

# Plot the backtest results
backtest.plot()
```

To run this backtest for real, you would need to install `backtesting.py` in your Python environment, along with any other necessary dependencies, and execute the script in an environment where these modules are available.
Before we proceed to code the backtest, let's break down the elements of the "ELITE" trading strategy and discuss how we will simplify and quantify each component for our strategy. Given the extensive description provided, weâ€™ll need to make some assumptions and simplifications to model the strategy programmatically. Here are some specific quantifiable rules we could apply based on the provided detail:

1. **Environment (E):** 
   - Trending: 50-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) slope is upward for uptrend, downward for downtrend.
   - Ranging: Price is oscillating between an upper and lower bound (Bollinger Bands with 2 standard deviations might help to identify this state). 
   - Breakout: Price moves beyond the Bollinger Bands.
   - Reversal: A reversal pattern such as a Head and Shoulders or inverse Head and Shoulders pattern is observed, or a significant change in direction from the SMA slope is noted.
   
2. **Levels (L):**
   - Support/Resistance: Identified by previous high/low points or psychological levels where price has shown to react in the past.
   
3. **Entries (E):**
   - For a breakout, an entry after a confirmed break of the level with increased volume.
   - For trending, an entry after a pullback to a trendline or moving average.
   - For a reversal, an entry after confirmation of the reversal pattern.
   - For ranging, an entry near the bottom of the range with bullish confirmation or at the top with bearish confirmation.
   
4. **Exits (E):**
   - Profit Take: At pre-defined supply/demand levels (e.g., previous swing highs/lows) or at a multiple of the risk taken (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio).
   - Stop Loss: A few pips below/above the entry pattern for long/short trades, respectively, or below/above the recent swing low/high.

For the purpose of the backtest, let's assume we are dealing with a daily time frame, and we will try to identify these components by using common technical indicators and price action. Also, we will work with historical data of BTC-USD with a 15-minute time frame, as specified, but will apply the strategy as if it were on a daily time frame due to limitations in our explanation and complexity.

Please note which simplifications are acceptable or if there should be any adjustments, and we can begin to write the backtest in Python using the `backtesting.py` module.
