# The warning has been resolved, and our backtest now avoids using chained assignment. After rerunning the backtest with the adjustment, we still end up with a final portfolio value of approximately \$424.46 and a total return of roughly -95.76%. It's clear that the strategy performed very poorly with this simulated data set.
#
# The key points of the backtest script include:
# - The Moving Average crossover trading strategy.
# - We start with a cash balance of \$10,000.
# - Buy signals are generated when the short moving average crosses above the long moving average.
# - Sell signals are generated when the short moving average crosses below the long moving average.
# - The script calculates the number of shares to buy or sell based on the available cash balance without accounting for transaction costs or slippage.
# - The portfolio value is tracked over time to calculate the final return at the end of the simulation.
#
# If this were a real backtest, we would need to consider additional factors such as commissions, slippage, and potentially more sophisticated risk management, position sizing, and exit strategies.
# I've made the necessary adjustments to the code to avoid chained assignment. However, a FutureWarning suggests we should not use `.loc` for positional slicing. I'll switch to using `.iloc` instead, which is the recommended approach. Also, the backtest results remain unchanged, with the ending portfolio value being around \$424.46 and the total return at approximately -95.76%.
#
# Let me correct that warning and rerun the backtest to ensure it's handled properly.
# It seems there is a warning about the way we are setting the 'Signal' values. This is because Pandas prefers us to avoid chained assignment when setting values. I'll fix that with the `loc` method. Also, the final output indicates that the backtesting resulted in a total portfolio value of approximately \$424.46 at the end of the period. Since we started with \$10,000, this represents a significant loss, with a total return of approximately -95.76%. This is indicative that the strategy performed quite poorly in this simulated data set. Let me fix the warning first and then let's analyze the backtesting logic for any possible issues.
# Before implementing a backtesting script, we need to decide on a simple trading strategy. For this example, let's use a basic moving average crossover strategy:
#
# - Buy signal: when the short-term moving average (e.g., 20-day) crosses above the long-term moving average (e.g., 50-day).
# - Sell signal: when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.
#
# We will use Pandas to calculate moving averages, generate signals based on those averages, and then backtest the strategy.
#
# Let's write the script for backtesting this mock strategy using the data generated.
