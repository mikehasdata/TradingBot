It seems that there was an error when trying to load the Bitcoin data, as the file was not found at the specified path. This could be due to a typo in the file path, or the file might not have been uploaded properly. 

To proceed, please confirm the file path and ensure the data file is correctly uploaded to the `/mnt/data` directory. Once we have the correct file path or the file is uploaded, we can run the code again to load the data and execute the backtest.
The provided trading strategy is rather complex and requires a multi-timeframe analysis approach, which needs to incorporate both trend detection and breakout identification. `backtesting.py` is ideal for backtesting rule-based strategies on historical data but has certain limitations, such as typically dealing with a single timeframe per strategy.

However, for the sake of this exercise, we'll focus on simplifying the strategy to fit within the constraints of backtesting a single timeframe. We will use the 15-minute timeframe data, interpret a breakout in the trend using local highs and lows, and use a fixed risk-reward ratio for stop-loss and take-profit levels.

Below is a simplified version of the strategy ready for backtesting with `backtesting.py`. We simulate the multi-timeframe aspect by using lookback periods to establish the trend and breakouts, but note that this simplification may not fully capture the nuances of the strategy described in the video.

```python
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover
from backtesting.test import GOOG # Will later replace with Bitcoin data
import pandas as pd

# Define the strategy based on the simplified interpretation of the given trend-following system
class TrendFollowingStrategy(Strategy):
    n1 = 30  # Lookback period for the trend (represents one-hour using 15-minute candles)
    n2 = 2   # Lookback period for the breakout (represents 15-minute candles)
    
    def init(self):
        self.trend_high = self.I(self.data.High.rolling(self.n1).max)
        self.trend_low = self.I(self.data.Low.rolling(self.n1).min)
        self.breakout_high = self.I(self.data.High.rolling(self.n2).max)
        self.breakout_low = self.I(self.data.Low.rolling(self.n2).min)
        
    def next(self):
        risk_reward_ratio = 2  # For a risk-reward ratio of 1:2
        stop_loss = 0
        
        if crossover(self.data.Close, self.trend_high):
            # Enter long if price crosses over the high of the trend period
            self.buy()
            stop_loss = abs(self.breakout_low[-1] - self.data.Close[-1])
            self.position.tp = self.data.Close[-1] + risk_reward_ratio * stop_loss
            self.position.sl = self.breakout_low[-1]
            
        elif crossover(self.trend_low, self.data.Close):
            # Enter short if price crosses under the low of the trend period
            self.sell()
            stop_loss = abs(self.breakout_high[-1] - self.data.Close[-1])
            self.position.tp = self.data.Close[-1] - risk_reward_ratio * stop_loss
            self.position.sl = self.breakout_high[-1]

# Load the Bitcoin data
path = '/mnt/data/BTC-USD-15m-2023-1-01T00_00 (1).csv'
bitcoin_data = pd.read_csv(path, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)
bitcoin_data = bitcoin_data[['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]

# Run the backtest using the loaded Bitcoin data
bt = Backtest(bitcoin_data, TrendFollowingStrategy, cash=10000, commission=.002)
stats = bt.run()
print(stats)
```

The `TrendFollowingStrategy` class above is simplified and does not perfectly replicate multi-timeframe analysis, but it provides a basic strategy for backtesting purposes. To properly run this code, we first need to load the real Bitcoin data you mentioned, which has been saved at the given path. In the above code, the `GOOG` dataset is just a placeholder.

Letâ€™s load the Bitcoin data and run the backtest.
