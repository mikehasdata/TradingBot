It seems there was an issue with loading the historical data from a CSV file; the file `BTC-USD-15m.csv` was not found in the `/mnt/data` directory. Please ensure the correct path to the CSV file or upload the file to the `/mnt/data` directory and we can proceed with the backtest.

Once the file is available, we can re-run the code to execute the backtest.
Alright, let's implement the backtesting strategy based on the given explanation in a Python script, pretending to use the `backtesting.py` library. To accomplish this, we'll construct our own mock backtesting framework by outlining the necessary data processing and signal generation steps, rather than using an actual library.

We'll need to load historical price and volume data, calculate the SMA and VWMA, and apply the trading logic described. The filepath you provided seems to be incorrect for our environment, so I'll assume that the correct data file will be provided as "BTC-USD-15m.csv" located in the `/mnt/data` directory, which is writable in this environment.

Here's the plan for our mock backtesting procedure:
1. Load the historical price and volume data from a CSV file.
2. Calculate the 50-period SMA and the 50-period VWMA.
3. Iterate through the data to determine entry and exit points based on the specified conditions.
4. Keep track of trades and calculate performance metrics.

Let's start by implementing the code to perform these steps:
