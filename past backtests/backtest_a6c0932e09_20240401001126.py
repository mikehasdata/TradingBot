# The backtest has now executed with trades being made according to the adjusted strategy. The script logged each trade with its date, action (BUY/SELL), number of shares, and the price at which the action was taken.
#
# Here's a summary of the backtest results:
#
# - Final cash remaining: $0.92
# - Shares held at the end of the period: 22 shares
# - Total value of the portfolio (cash + shares' value): $22.71
# - Profit or loss: -$9977.29
#
# It's clear that the random trading strategy led to a significant loss, which is not surprising given its simplicity and the random nature of price movements in our mock market data.
#
# Please note: In a live trading scenario or a more nuanced backtest, we would include transaction costs, slippage, and potentially have more sophisticated risk management and position sizing.
#
# Would you like to proceed with any modifications to the strategy, further backtest analysis, or visualization of the backtest results?
# It appears that the backtest logic executed, but no trades were made. This is likely because the 'Close' prices were set exactly equal to the 'Open' prices in our mock data generation process, creating a scenario where the strategy's conditions for buying and selling are never met.
#
# To fix this, we can modify the mock data generation step to ensure there is some variability between the 'Open' and 'Close' prices. Let's introduce some randomness to the 'Close' prices to make them differ from the 'Open' prices, thus allowing our strategy to trigger some trades.
# To create a backtest script, we will follow these general steps:
#
# 1. Generate the mock data.
# 2. Define a simple buy/sell strategy.
# 3. Implement the backtesting logic:
#    - Initialize variables to track performance and positions.
#    - Loop through the data and apply the strategy.
#    - Calculate performance metrics.
# 4. Print or plot the results.
#
# Let's create a simple strategy where we buy at the close when the close price is higher than the open price, and we sell when the close price is lower than the open price.
#
# First, we'll generate the mock data as per the snippet you provided and then define and implement the backtesting logic.
