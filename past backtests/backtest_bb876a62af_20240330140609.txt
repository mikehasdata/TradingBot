To proceed with the backtest, we'll need to load the historical data from the specified CSV file. However, the path provided seems to reference a local file on your desktop, which won't be accessible from here. Instead, you should either upload the file here or provide a sample of your data that I can use to demonstrate the backtest.

Given that you've asked to implement the strategy using backtesting.py, I'll outline the steps I intend to follow once I have access to the data:

1. Load the historical price data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Calculate the MACD indicator with the specified parameters.
3. Define the trading strategy including entry and exit signals.
4. Backtest the trading strategy to see how it would have performed historically.

As soon as you can provide the data by uploading the CSV file, I'll be able to code the backtest for you. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
