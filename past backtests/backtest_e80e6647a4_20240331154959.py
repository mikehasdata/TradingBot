# To begin backtesting the given trading strategy, we need to create a Python script that uses historical price data and RSI calculations to simulate trades following the specified rules. Since we don't have access to the backtesting.py package or internet, I will create a simple backtester from scratch. Please note that for a complete backtest, you need access to historical data for each of the time frames mentioned (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute charts).
#
# Please upload the file 'BTC-USD-15m-2023-1-01T00_00 (1).csv' or provide the historical data for the asset you wish to backtest.
#
# Once we have the historical price dataset, I can proceed with the steps as follows:
# 1. Load the data.
# 2. Calculate the RSI for the relevant time frames.
# 3. Apply the trading rules to generate buy/sell signals.
# 4. Calculate the performance of the strategy and display the results.
#
# Let's start step-by-step. First, please upload the 'BTC-USD-15m-2023-1-01T00_00 (1).csv' file or provide historical price data in CSV format, so we can simulate the strategy.
